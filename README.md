# Setup
This project tracks the latest master builds of Zig. Versions older than the latest one at the [Zig downloads page](https://ziglang.org/download/) might not work.

Only compatible with the [provided server source](https://github.com/Slendergo/zig-server-compat).

Change ```pub const app_engine_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/";``` in settings.zig in order to connect to a server that is not localhost.
